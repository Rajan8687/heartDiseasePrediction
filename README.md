# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. The analysis is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook and includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## üìñ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a classifier that can accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease. The process involves:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** To prepare the data for modeling, including feature scaling and splitting.
3.  **Model Training:** To train two different classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
4.  **Evaluation:** To assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, provided here as `heart.csv`.

**Features:**

| `thalach`  | Maximum heart rate achieved                                 |
| `exang`    | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)                   |
| `oldpeak`  | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest          |
| `slope`    | The slope of the peak exercise ST segment                   |
| `ca`       | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy        |
| `thal`     | Thallium stress test result                                 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow as detailed in the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    -   The `heart.csv` dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
    -   Initial data checks (`.info()`, `.head()`) are performed to understand its structure and confirm there are no missing values.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Visualizations are created to gain insights into the data:
        -   **Heart Disease by Gender:** A count plot showing the distribution of heart disease across genders.
        -   **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap illustrating the correlation between all features.
        -   **Age vs. Max Heart Rate:** A scatter plot to visualize the relationship between age, maximum heart rate, and the presence of heart disease.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   The data is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
    -   **Feature Scaling:** `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn is used to standardize the feature values.
    -   **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

4.  **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    -   Two models are trained and evaluated:
        -   **Logistic Regression**
        -   **Random Forest Classifier**
    -   The models are evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set.

## üìà Results

Both models performed well, with the Random Forest model showing strong results.

-   **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** `85.2%`
-   **Random Forest Classifier Accuracy:** `85.2%`

### Random Forest Model Evaluation

The evaluation metrics for the Random Forest model provide a deeper look into its performance:

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
[[24  5]
 [ 4 28]]
```

**Classification Report:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.86      0.83      0.84        29
           1       0.85      0.88      0.86        32

    accuracy                           0.85        61
   macro avg       0.85      0.85      0.85        61
weighted avg       0.85      0.85      0.85        61
```
The model demonstrates a balanced ability to predict both the presence and absence of heart disease, with an overall accuracy of 85%.
